    "Throughout this entire notebook you should be experimenting with the code in the non-text cells. A great way to begin to get a feel for Python is by playing with it. So have some fun by changing the values in the cells and then running them again with Shift-Enter. Before you do, think about what you expect the output to be, and make sure your intuition matches up with what you run. If it doesn't, take some time to think about what happened so you can hone your intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each section there will be some questions to help further your understanding. Remember, in Python we can always manually test code by running it; however, you should try to think about the answers to these questions before you run some code. This way you can check and verify your understanding of the section's topic.\n",

    "# Intro to Numpy \n",
    "\n",
    "Tonight, we're going to start off with a foray into the `Numpy` library, which is one of the fundamental packages for scientific computing in Python. It turns out that the `Pandas DataFrames` we worked with last class are actually built off the `numpy array` (which we'll get to), so it's important to have some basic knowldege of what's running under the hood of our `DataFrames`. We started with `DataFrames` as opposed to `numpy arrays` because they are a little bit more intuitive and we're able to interact with them from a higher level (this is largely due to the ability to label our data). \n",
    "\n",
    "While `Numpy` offers an amazing amount of functionality (see the [docs](http://www.numpy.org/) for a better idea), one of it's mainstays is the `numpy array` (an n-dimensional array), which is what we'll focus on tonight. There are loads of things that you can do with `numpy arrays`, and tonight we're going to introduce some of their amazing capabilities. Learning about everything `numpy arrays` can do really just takes working with them day in and day out, and so tonight we'll try to aim for breadth over depth. We want you to walk out of tonight with an idea of the many things you can do with `numpy` and `numpy arrays`, and the types of situations where you would want to use them. \n",

    "## The basics of the Array\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What's the big deal with Numpy Arrays?\n",
    "\n",
    "What's so special about a `numpy array`? From a high level, they are kind of like lists - they just store a bunch of stuff in a container. It turns out, though, that a numpy array is much faster to interact with and perform certain types of calculations with than a standard Python list. Why is that, though? The two main reasons that they are faster are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. They are stored as one contiguous block of memory, rather than being spread out across multiple locations like a list. \n",
    "2. Each item in a numpy array is of the same data type (i.e. all integers, all floats, etc.), rather than a conglomerate of any number of data types (as a list is). We call this idea homogeneity, as opposed to the possible heterogeneity of Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just how much faster are they? Let's take the numbers from 0 to 1 million, and sum those numbers, timing it with both a list and a numpy array."

    "So, numpy runs nearly an order of magnitude faster! This is because of those two points above. Because numpy arrays store data in contiguous blocks of memory, they are able to take advantage of **vectorization**, which is the ability of a CPU to perform one operation on mulitiple pieces of data at once. In addition, since a numpy array knows what type each object it is storing is (and those types don't change), it doesn't have to waste time checking what type each object is (like a list). The combo of these two things speeds up our calcualtion quite a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, too, that we had to specify `np.sum()` - numpy's implementation of sum. When we just used the built-in Python `sum()` on the numpy array, the calculation was actually slower! This is because numpy arrays are optimized for vectorized computations, and when we try to do a non-vectorized operation we pay a price. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's start with how we can create a `numpy array`. To do this, we use the `np.array()` constructor, which expects some kind of array or something that exposes the array interface (i.e. acts like an array - lists and tuples are examples). So, this means that we can create a numpy array by passing in a list or tuple. "
