    "This notebook here is meant to get you oriented with one of the tools that we will be using for our class notes. Class notes will be built into IPython notebooks (like this one). Before coming to each class, you should read the class notes, and play around/follow along with the code in those notebooks. You should run the code provided, and additionally modify it to learn what happens when you change certain pieces. Effectively learning to program means having your hands-on the keyboard often. It means playing with code, breaking code, reading errors, and reading google. It means banging your head against the keyboard, but getting to revel in that time spent banging your head when you're program finally works. To that end, this notebook here will hopefully give you a taste of that. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start off having you type some working code, and playing around with it. Then, we'll walk you through an example of working with some broken code (don't worry, it won't be too bad). Finally, we'll finish up by having you move the working code into a `script`, and you'll run you're very first Python program! \n",

    "For the first part, type in the following code. **Type** it one line at a time into a cell, and then run that cell (click the button at the top to do this, or try `Shift + Enter`). Don't copy and paste it, but instead type it. Building up your programming chops will come through muscle memory, and tonight will get you started with that. You will be writing you're own programs soon enough! \n",
