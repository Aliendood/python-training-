# Instructions 

Tonight we'll be working through solving more problems, but this time by building functions.  For each of the problems that you work through tonight, you should build a function into your solution. While we'll discuss general workflow in the next class, tonight you can just build each function into it's own file, and then call it with some arguments right after you defined it. For example, pretend all of the following is the solution to one of the problems, written in a function first and then called (for testing purposes) below. 

```python 
def my_func(param1, param2, param3): 
    # Function code to solve the problem

print my_func(param11, param21, param31)
print my_func(param12, param22, param32)
print my_func(param13, param23, param33)
print my_func(param14, param24, param34)
print my_func(param15, param25, param35)
```

Note above that I've called my function five times after I defined it (and I've put a print in front of it so that when I call the script from the command line it'll print the results) - this is to test out that it works correctly with different sets of arguments. You should aim to test yours at least 5 times tonight after you write it.
