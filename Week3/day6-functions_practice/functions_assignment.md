# Instructions

Tonight you're going to be writing a program that does something cool! You're going to write a script that allows two people to play tic-tac-toe! This is a much more involved problem than any you've seen in this class so far. In general you should be thinking about how to break up your solution, as you write it, into smaller parts. In addition you should be giving all your functions good names good names as you separate your code out. 

The assignment will give suggestions on how to write this program. But remember, there's always more than one solution to any programming problem. So, if you want to do something that's not suggested by the assignment, by all means, give it a try! If you want to talk with someone about what you're thinking about implementing talk an instructor or one of your peers. Frequently, talking about the problem will help you get a better handle on it, and therefore, how to solve it.
