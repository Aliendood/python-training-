Tonight you're going to be solving problems that require you to write functions like last time. However, this time the questions will involve more complicated answers. Because of this you should be thinking about how to break up the solutions you write into smaller parts. In addition you should be giving all the functions good names. On top of this, write all of your solutions in a single script and have a main block at the bottom that tests each solution you write.
