## Object Oriented Programming Lab

For the last 4 weeks you have been learning about data structures, design principles, and problem solving tactics in Python. Today you are going to put that all into practice - there is no lecture today. Instead you will complete a single assignment that walks you through writing a program that does something cool and useful.

The assignment is designed to help guide you through the decision making process that you would be faced with if you were to tackle the problem by yourself. This will help you develop intuition for the kinds of choices you'll want to make when solving your own novel questions in Python in the future.

While the assignment will suggest you take certain paths while solving the problem and even teach you new Python functionality which could aid in an easier solution, there is certainly not a single solution. So please consider other tactics you could take while working through the assignment and if you think there's a better option than the one suggested by the assignment, by all means, give it a try! The worst thing that can happen is that you'll learn, and that's what you're here to do. The instructors will be around to discuss different options with you to further aid in your journey of thinking about programming problems.
