    "# Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Tonight we're going to get practice working in Pandas. We'll walk through instantiating a `DataFrame`, reading data into it, looking at and examining that data, and then playing with it. We'll be using the data in the `data` folder located within this directory (it'll be the same wine data that we've looked at during lecture). \n",
    "\n",
    "# Assignment Questions \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1 - The basics of DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start off by following the general workflow that we use when moving data into a DataFrame: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Importing Pandas\n",
    "    * Reading data into the DataFrame\n",
    "    * Getting a general sense of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in terms of what you should do for this part...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import pandas\n",
    "2. Read the wine data into DataFrames. \n",
    "3. Use the `attributes` and `methods` available on DataFrames to answer the following questions: \n",
    "    * How many rows and columns are in each DataFrame?\n",
    "    * What data type is in each column?\n",
    "    * Are all of the variables continuous, or are any categorical?\n",
    "    * How many non-null values are in each column?\n",
    "    * What are the min, mean, max, median for all numeric columns?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2 - Practice with grabbing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now get some practice with just grabbing certain parts of data. If you'd like some extra practice, then try answering each of the questions in more than one way (because remember, we can often grab our data in a couple of different ways). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Grab the first 10 rows of the `chlorides` column. \n",
    "2. Grab the last 10 rows of the `chlorides` column. \n",
    "3. Grab indices 264-282 of the `chlorides` **and** `density` columns. \n",
    "4. Grab all rows where the `chlorides` value is less than 0.10. \n",
    "5. Now grab all the rows where the `chlorides` value is greater than it's mean (try **not** to use a hard-coded value for the mean, but instead a method).\n",
    "6. Grab all those rows where the `pH` is greater than 3.0 and less than 3.5. \n",
    "7. Further filter the results from 6 to grab only those rows that have a `residual sugar` less than 2.0. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3 - More Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's move on to just trying to do more complicated things. Use your knowledge of `groupbys`, `sorting`, and the other things that we learned in lecture to answer the following. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get the average amount of `chlorides` for each `quality` value. \n",
    "2. For observations with a `pH` greater than 3.0 and less than 4.0, find the average `alcohol` value by `pH`. \n",
    "3. For observations with an `alcohol` value between 9.25 and 9.5, find the highest amount of `residual sugar`. \n",
    "4. Create a new column, called `total_acidity`, that is the sum of `fixed acidity` and `volatile acidity`. \n",
    "5. Find the average `total_acidity` for each of the `quality` values. \n",
    "6. Find the top 5 `density` values. \n",
    "7. Find the 10 lowest `sulphates` values. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 4 - Practice with Plotting \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plot the average amount of `chlorides` for each `quality` value (1 from Part 3). \n",
    "2. Plot the `alcohol` as a function of `pH`. Does there appear to be any relationship between the two?\n",
    "3. Plot `total_acidity` as a function of `pH`. Does there appear to be any relationship between the two?\n",
    "4. Plot a histogram of the `quality` values. Are they evenly distributed within the data set?\n",
    "5. Plot a boxplot to look at the distribution of `citric acid`. "
