# Instructions

As with your previous assignment, tonight's will get you practice with the data structures you learned about tonight. While most of the problems will be centered around tuples, dictionaries and sets, as they build on the structures you've already learned those will certainly be part of the questions and solutions you may come up with. 

# Assignment Questions

### Part 1 - Practice with Tuples

1. Write a script that prompts the user to input numbers numbers separated by commas. Your script will take these numbers and store them as a list of tuples, taken two at a time, and print that to the user.
 
 Example: If you inputted the numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6` to your script would print `[(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]`
