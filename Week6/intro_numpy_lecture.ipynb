    "# Intro to Numpy \n",
    "\n",
    "Tonight we're going to start off with a little detour into the `Numpy` library, which is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It turns out that the `Pandas DataFrames` that we worked with last class are actually but off the `numpy array` (which we'll get to), so it's important to have some basic knowldege of what's running under the hood of our `DataFrames`. We started with `Pandas DataFrames` as opposed to `Numpy` and `numpy arrays` because they are a little bit more intuitive, and we're able to interact with them from a much higher level. \n",
    "\n",
    "While `Numpy` offers a number of things (see the [docs](http://www.numpy.org/) for a better idea), one of it's mainstays is the `numpy array`, which is what we'll focus on tonight. \n"
