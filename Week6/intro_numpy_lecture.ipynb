    "# Intro to Numpy \n",
    "\n",
    "Tonight we're going to start off with a little detour into the `Numpy` library, which is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It turns out that the `Pandas DataFrames` that we worked with last class are actually but off the `numpy array` (which we'll get to), so it's important to have some basic knowldege of what's running under the hood of our `DataFrames`. We started with `Pandas DataFrames` as opposed to `Numpy` and `numpy arrays` because they are a little bit more intuitive, and we're able to interact with them from a much higher level. \n",
    "\n",
    "While `Numpy` offers a number of things (see the [docs](http://www.numpy.org/) for a better idea), one of it's mainstays is the `numpy array` (an n-dimensional array), which is what we'll focus on tonight. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The basics\n",
    "\n",
    "What's so special about a `numpy array`? From a high level, they are kind of like lists - they just store a bunch of stuff in a container. Okay, great, so what's the big deal? Well, it turns out that a `numpy array` is much faster to interact with and perform calculations with than a standard list. Why is that, though? The two main reasons that they are faster are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. They are stored as one contiguous block of memory, rather than being spread out across multiple locations like a list. \n",
    "2. Each item in a `numpy array` is of the same data type (i.e. all integers, all floats, etc.), rather than a conglomerate of any number of data types (as a list is). \n",
    "\n",
    "Just how much faster are they? Well, let's take the numbers from 0 to 1 million, and sum those numbers, timing it with both a list a numpy array."

    "Woah, so it's about 5 times faster! This is because of those two points above. Because numpy arrays store data in contiguous blocks of memory, it is able to take advantage of **vectorization**, which is the ability of a CPU to perform one operation on mulitiple pieces of data at once. In addition, since a numpy array knows what type each object it is storing is (and those types don't change), it doesn't have to waste time checking what type each object is (like a list). The combo of these two things speeds up our calcualtion quite a bit. \n",

We're not going to cover everything that you can do with `numpy arrays` (see the [methods docs](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy.ndarray) for that), but we'll look at the basics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with how we can create a `numpy array`. To do this, we use the `np.array()` constructor, which as the docs state, expects some kind of array or something that exposes the array interface (i.e. acts like an array - lists and tuples are examples). So, this means that we can create a numpy array by passing in a list or tuple. "
