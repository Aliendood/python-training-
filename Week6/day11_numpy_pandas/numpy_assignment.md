# Instructions 

For the first part of the assignment, we'll solving problems by using `numpy`. Since `Pandas` is built on top of `numpy`, it's good to be familiar with `numpy`, and know what it provides. Below, we'll ask that you solve functions **by using `numpy`**. While you could answer the questions below without using `numpy` arrays, the focus of these questions is for you to use `numpy` arrays. Remember how fast they are compared to the `list` as alternative!
