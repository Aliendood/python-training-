    "Throughout this entire notebook you should be experimenting with the code in the non-text cells. A great way to begin to get a feel for Python is by playing with it. So have some fun by changing the values in the cells and then running them again with Shift-Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each section there will be some questions to help further your understanding. Remember, in Python we can always manually test things by trying them out; however, you should try to think about the answers to these questions before you run some code. This way you can check and verify your understanding of the section's topic.\n",

    "We've been talking about this idea of iterables for a while now and have seen our first example of it already when looking at strings. What other data structures does Python have for us to iterate through?\n",

    "#### Intro to Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are a more complex type of data structure. From a high level, lists are collections of ordered items. These items can be of any type, and a list can contain items of different types (or all the same type). You can construct a list in one of two ways. The first is simply by passing an arbitrary number of items into square brackets, `[]`, separated by commas. The second is by passing an iterable into the `list()` constructor (we'll discuss exactly what an iterable and constructor are later). For example..."

Also, note again that we are able to place multiple different types of data structures into our lists. If we wanted to, we could even create a list of lists (and later we'll see we can make lists of any of the other data structures we learn).  "
