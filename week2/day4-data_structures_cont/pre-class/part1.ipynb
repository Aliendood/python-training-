    "Throughout this entire notebook you should be experimenting with the code in the non-text cells. A great way to begin to get a feel for Python is by playing with it. So have some fun by changing the values in the cells and then running them again with Shift-Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each section there will be some questions to help further your understanding. Remember, in Python we can always manually test things by trying them out; however, you should try to think about the answers to these questions before you run some code. This way you can check and verify your understanding of the section's topic.\n",

    "## Data Structures Continued\n",
    "\n",
    "Up till now you have learned about some very useful data structures in Python: numeric types, strings, and lists. However, the fun doesn't stop there! Today we are going to talk about some other data structures that will allow us to solve very different problems from those that we have been solving so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutability\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that will come up as an important distinction in the structures we learn about today is the concept of mutability. **Mutability** refers to the capability of an object to be changed after it has been instantiated. With lists, we can change the contents at any arbitrary index and even grow the list dynamically..."

    "Mutability is nice, but there are times when you won't want your data structure to be mutable. For example, if you're allowing a user of your program to have access to a data structure, one way to ensure that they won't mess with it (sometimes users do this out of malice, and we want to try and prevent it) is to make the structure **immutable**. There are many more reasons why immutability is a desired trait, and we will discuss plenty more of them throughout the rest of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly discuss the mutability of objects you already know about. The first types you learned about were various numerics (`int`, `float`, `complex`) - these are all immutable. What?! Immutable you say? But I can change a value in a variable after it's been declared. Consider the following simple code."

    "How can numerics be immutable while at the same time allowing us to change the value of a variable that holds a numeric? What's really going on under the hood when you assign a value to a variable is that Python puts that value or data structure in memory, and then simply associates the variable name with that value or data structure. Changing a variable, then, simply amounts to associating that name with a different thing in memory.\n",

    "### Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are simply the immutable brother of the `list`. Tuples are immutable ordered collections. This means that once a tuple is instantiated, all you can do is access its contents. You cannot make a tuple longer. You cannot reassign what is in a tuple (there are some subtleties to this which we will discuss presently). Similar to lists, tuples are declared by passing an iterable to the `tuple()` constructor, with the syntactic sugary parenthesis, or without parenthesis (this works because Python automatically interprets comma separated things that aren't specifically specified otherwise as tuples)."

The error message is pretty self explanatory. In plain English, it tells us that tuples have no ability to append. This is just as we expected given that they are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be asking yourself what a tuple can store? The answer is, just as with lists, anything! Just as with lists, the elements of tuples can be accessed via zero-based indexing, and looped through with a `for` loop. And just as with lists, the elements in a tuple can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous (know though, that there are structures in Python that enforce homogeneity). Let's stick with looking at tuples for now, and take a look at some of the things we can store."
