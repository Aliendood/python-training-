# Instructions

Tonight we'll be working on building out the `OurClass` class that we looked at in lecture, as well as building out another class that we'll have interact with `OurClass`. We'll call that class `Member`. Your goal by the end of the night is to implement these classes by following along with the guidelines below (i.e. implementing the classes with the attributes and methods discussed below), such that you have a firmer grasp on building your own classes and having them interact with each other.
