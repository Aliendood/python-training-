# Installing Sublime

This installation isn't as involved as Anaconda. You just need to navigate
to the [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/2) site and download the version of 
Sublime corresponding to your operating system (Windows or Mac OS X).

## Windows Users

Once you are done installing it, double check that it works by opening the 
sublime editor. I suggest creating a desktop shortcut for sublime or pinning
it to you taskbar for easy access. We'll be using it a lot. 

## Mac Users

Once you are done installing it, a window should pop up that allows you to 
move it into your applications folder. I suggest doing that, and then 
also putting it down in your dock for easy access, or creating a desktop 
shortcut.
