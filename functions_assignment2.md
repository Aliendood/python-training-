# Instructions 

Tonight we'll work through building functions and getting practice with their syntax. We'll begin by having you complete function definitions that are already written, and then move on to you writing function definitions for code that is already written. Next, we'll work on translating some of the code we've already written into functions. We'll finish up by writing some functions of our own, from start to finish.
