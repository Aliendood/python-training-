# Data Science Fundamentals

The main objective for this course is for you to leave with a fundamental understanding of programming within Python.  If this is your first programming language, then you will feel a very steep learning curve.  The goal of this course is to assist you with overcoming that learning curve, so you can not only continue to grow in this environment, but so that you can start learning from the vast amount of information that is available to you through the online community.  

Having a strong foundation in math/statistics and programming is imperative to success in the data science world.  The aim of this course will be at the foundation of programming.  Often the most difficult part is just getting started.  We are here to help with that process.
