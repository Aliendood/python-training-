# Practicing with Unix

This assignment will give you some practice navigating around the terminal
and using some of the commands we have talked about. Because we will be 
working with the terminal throughout the entirety of this program and you 
will be building up familiarity with it throughout the program, this 
assignment will be fairly brief. 

1.) Open up your terminal and navigate to your root directory. 

2.) In your root directory, create a new directory called 
`test_directory`.

3.) Navigate into `test_directory`, and print the working directory
to the screen. Is the pathname printed to the screen an absolute path
or relative path?

4.) Create two files, calling them `test_file1.txt` and `test_file2.txt`. 

5.) Use `ls` to make sure that the files are in fact in the directory. 

6.) Copy `test_file1.txt` to a new file, calling it `test_file3.txt`. How
many files are there in your directory now? 

7.) Rename `test_file3.txt` to `test_file4.txt`. How many files are there 
in your directory now?

8.) Within `test_directory`, create a new directory called `inner_directory`.

9.) In one command, move all of the files from `test_directory` into the 
`inner_directory`. 

10.) In one command, delete `inner_directory` and all its contents. 

11.) Navigate back to your root directory, and delete `test_directory` using 
`rmdir`. Why does `rmdir` work here (**Hint**: Think about what's left in 
`test_directory`)?
