# DSI-evening-prep

12/15 At the Info Session we had a number of individuals interested in picking up programming, but they currently have little to no experience and do not want to quit jobs when they are not sure this is even their current route of interest.  Evening classes for these individuals might peak their interest.  They also (likely) have weaker math backgrounds.

Another large group of people are interested in the immersive, and they might want a bit more difficult set of materials to get started.  Most of these individuals still do not have a ton of coding experience - and if they do have experience it does not seem to be with python, but rather with SAS and SQL.
