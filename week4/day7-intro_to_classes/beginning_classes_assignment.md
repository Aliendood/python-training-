# Instructions 

Tonight we'll work through building classes and getting practice with their syntax. We'll begin by having you complete class constructors that are already written, and then move on to having you write class constructors for some code that is already written. After that, we'll move on to building a class or two of our own!

For each of the classes you build tonight, you should test them out. Try instantiating a couple of different instances of each class you build, and make sure they work the way that you would expect. A couple of questions to ask yourself are: 

* If I tab complete, do I see the attributes/methods that I would expect?
* If I examine an attribute of my instantiated class/object, is it's value what you would expect?
* Do the methods that you've defined in your class work as expected for your instantiated class/object?
